 + Added tmi files for the tared atlases which make the  map loading faster
 
 ~ Changed preview viewer to JMapViewer. It has several advantages:
    different map sources 
    preview loads in background automatically
    easy zooming (mouse wheel) and movement (right mouse button)
 ~ Tar generation rewritten, each tar is now only opened one time, not 
   once for each tile to be added (increases tar creation in case of a virus 
   scanner being active)
 
 0.8:
 + Added xml based settings file via Java Properties
 + Added possibility to change tile size for the downloaded tiles.
 + Added possibility to set map size in atlas. Giving the possibility to create 
    large atlases 
  
 ! Fixed the non working setting tile store enabled. It was always enabled, 
    despite of what was written in the settings file
 ! Fixed (hopefully) the generation of mixed up atlases at some Linux operating 
    system(s).
 ! Fixed bugs related to defect profiles in profiles.xml file by adding some 
    validation of the xml data at application start.
  
0.7:
 + Added possibility to abort an ongoing download of Atlas
 + Added label that shows how many tiles that will be downloaded with current 
    lat, long & zoom settings 
 + Added persistent tile store (cache of tiles in a store which is persistent 
    between program sessions) 

 ! Fixed wrong download link to ditu.google.com
 
  0.61:
 + Added a possibility to select to download tiles from either ditu.google.com 
    or maps.google.com
  
 ! Fixed hard coded look and feel, which resulted in an 
    javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException at other environments then Windows
