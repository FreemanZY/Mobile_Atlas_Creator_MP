    additional library "Java Advanced Imaging": https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
    Download the library and place the Jar[s] in the same directory as TrekBuddyAtlasCreator

 ~ Exceptions that occur while downloading/creating an atlas are now displayed
    in an dialog showing detailed information about the system and the exception
 ~ Updated Google Maps url & removed "Galileo" appendix

 ~ Changed preview viewer to JMapViewer. It has several advantages:
    different map sources 
    preview loads in background automatically
    easy zooming (mouse wheel) and movement (right mouse button)
 ~ Tar generation rewritten, each tar is now only opened one time, not 
   once for each tile to be added (increases tar creation in case of a virus 
   scanner being active)

 + Added xml based settings file via Java Properties
 + Added possibility to change tile size for the downloaded tiles.
 + Added possibility to set map size in atlas. Giving the possibility to create
